# 1337code_trials
A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems. This repository is organized by problem type and difficulty level. I solve and log each problem with detailed explanations and efficient (and inefficient) code implementations.

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of LeetCode problem solutions. Here, I log my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by type and difficulty. This repository serves as a personal log and a resource for others preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

## How to Use
Browse through the directories to find solutions to problems categorized by data structures and algorithms. Each solution includes a problem description, a detailed explanation of the approach, and the code implementation.

## Problem Categories
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
